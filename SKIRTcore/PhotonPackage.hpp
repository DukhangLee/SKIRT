/** The PhotonPackage class is used to describe photon packages, the basic luminosity packets that
    are transported during a radiative transfer simulation. Photon packages are monochromatic, i.e.
    they contain photons at a single wavelength (one of the wavelengths in the simulation's
    wavelength grid). Apart from its luminosity and wavelength, a photon package carries
    information about its origin (e.g. emission by a star or by a dust grain), about the
    interactions it experienced since its emission (e.g. the number of scattering events), and
    about its current path (e.g. starting position, propagation direction, list of dust cells being
    crossed). For performance reasons, a PhotonPackage object is usually constructed once at the
    start of a loop and then reused in the loop body for many consecutive launches; this allows the
    vectors with path information to remain allocated. Also, some trivial functions are implemented
    inline in the header. */
