/** An object of the PeerToPeerCommunicator class, inheriting from ProcessCommunicator, represents
    an environment or ensemble of processes, which are able to communicate according to the
    peer-to-peer model. This means that this class defines functions which implement decentralized
    communications: each process can send to and receive data from each other process. For its
    current use, only collective communications are defined in this class, involving the
    participation of all processes. Communication does not have to go throuh one particular
    process, as in the MasterSlaveCommunicator. Note, however, that this class does define a
    function isRoot(), discriminating between the processes. This is so because some operations are
    only to be performed by one single process, for example logging and writing out the results of
    the simulation to file. The point is that no process delegates what other processes should do
    and that data can flow from each arbritrary process to another. */
