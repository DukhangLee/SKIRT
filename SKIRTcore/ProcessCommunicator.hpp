/** The ProcessCommunicator class is an abstract class representing different types of
    communicators. The class inherits from SimulationItem so that it can be used within a SKIRT
    simulation hierarchy or FitSKIRT fitscheme hieararchy, and is accessible with the discovery
    mechanism. A communicator is used to represent an multiprocess environment, with a certain size
    (the number of processes) and where each process is assigned a certain rank. The communicator
    subclasses are designated for implementing the communication operations between its processes.
    Different communicators can implement different forms of communications, specific for a certain
    parallelization design. The ProcessCommunicator base class provides two data members: _rank and
    _Nprocs. These are declared private, meaning that the subclasses can only access these values
    through corresponding getter functions implemented by this class. */
