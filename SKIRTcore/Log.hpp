/** Log is the abstract base class for a message logging mechanism. It offers convenience functions
    for logging messages at various levels (info, warning, success, error), adding a time-stamp
    along the way. All of these functions eventually call a single pure virtual function, which
    must be implemented in a subclass to actually output the message to a device such as the
    console or a file. */

        ProcessCommunicator subclass. If none is found, because for example the simulation or fitscheme
        hierarchy has not yet been created, the function returns and _procName retains its empty state.
        If the find algorithm does succeed, the find algorithm is applied again, this time to invoke
        the setup of the ProcessCommunicator object, if this is not yet done. Then, the rank is
