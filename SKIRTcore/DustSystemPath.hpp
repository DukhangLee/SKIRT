/** The DustSystemPath class is a very technical class that is used to optimize the radiation
    transfer through a dust system. It is a record of and completely characterizes a path through a
    dusty medium. The path is characterized by the starting position \f${\bf{r}}\f$ and propagation
    direction \f${\bf{k}}\f$. Given this information and the structure of the dust system, one can
    exactly calculate which dust cells are passed through. For each dust cell, the DustSystemPath
    class objects records some information that can be useful for later calculations, such as the
    cell number (each dust cell in a dust component is assigned a cell number), the physical path
    length \f$\Delta s\f$ covered within the cell, the path length \f$s\f$ covered along the entire
    path up to the end of the cell, and the corresponding optical depths \f$\Delta\tau\f$ and
    \f$\tau\f$ at a the wavelength \f$\ell\f$. Internally, a DustSystemPath object is basically a
    collection of vectors with these data. */
