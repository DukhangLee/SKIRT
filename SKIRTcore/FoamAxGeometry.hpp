/** The FoamAxGeometry class is an abstract subclass of the AxGeometry class, and
    allows to construct stellar geometries characterized by an arbitrary axially symmetric density
    distribution \f$\rho({\bf{r}}) = \rho(R,z)\f$. For the generation of random positions from the
    density \f$\rho({\bf{r}})\f$, the FoamAxGeometry class uses a two-dimensional cell
    structure, called the foam. A foam is based on the two-dimensional unit square \f$[0,1]^2\f$,
    divided into many small rectangular cells. The distribution of the grid cells is performed
    completely automatically from any density distribution on the foam. The foam implementation,
    characterized by the Foam class, allows to efficiently generate random numbers drawn from this
    probability distribution on this unit square. One problem is that the stellar density
    \f$\rho(R,z)\f$ is defined on the infinite space \f$[0,\infty]\times[-\infty,\infty]\f$,
    whereas the foam requires a density distribution on the unit square. We solve this problem with
    a coordinate transformation from the usual cylindrical coordinates \f$(R,z)\f$ to new
    coordinates \f$(\bar{R}, \bar{z})\f$. The stellar density \f$\rho(R,z)\f$, normalized such that
    \f[ 2\pi \int_{-\infty}^\infty {\text{d}}z \int_0^\infty \rho(R,z)\, R\, {\text{d}}R = 1, \f]
    is transformed to a new density \f[ \bar\rho(\bar{R},\bar{z}) = 2\pi \rho\Bigl( R(\bar{R}),
    z(\bar{z}) \Bigr)\, R(\bar{R})\, \frac{{\text{d}}R}{{\text{d}}\bar{R}}\,
    \frac{{\text{d}}z}{{\text{d}}\bar{z}}. \f] It is obvious that this new density will now be
    normalized on the unit square, \f[ \int_0^1 {\text{d}}\bar{R} \int_0^1
    \bar\rho(\bar{R},\bar{z})\, {\text{d}}\bar{z} = 1. \f] There are obviously many different
    transformations we can apply. The one applied for the FoamAxGeometry class is
    characterized by \f[ \begin{split} R &= -a\ln\bar{R}, \\ z &= \frac{c}{\tan(\bar{z}\pi)},
    \end{split} \f] with \f$a\f$ and \f$c\f$ two scale parameters. The inverse transformation is
    \f[ \begin{split} \bar{R} &= \exp\left(-\frac{R}{a}\right), \\ \bar{z} &= \frac{1}{\pi}
    \arctan\left(\frac{c}{z}\right). \end{split} \f] With this transformation, the Jacobian reads
    \f[ \frac{{\text{d}}R}{{\text{d}}\bar{R}}\, \frac{{\text{d}}z}{{\text{d}}\bar{z}} =
    \frac{ac\,\pi}{\bar{R}\sin^2(\bar{z}\pi)}. \f] */
