/** The IdenticalAssigner class is a subclass of the ProcessAssigner class, representing objects
    that assign work to different processes. The IdenticalAssigner class is used to assign each
    process to the same work. When a certain method in another class requires the execution of
    different small parts of work, and it uses an object of this class as the process assigner,
    then all processes will execute all these parts. The execution of these parts is thus not
    parallelized with regard to the different processes, although each process can still execute
    these parts in parallel threads. Since each process executes the same algorithm, no
    communication is needed afterwards to accumulate the results.

    The assignment mechanism explained above is represented graphically in the following figure.
