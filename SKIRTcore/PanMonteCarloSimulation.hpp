        It consists of two nested loops: an outer loop that loops over all wavelengths, and an
        inner loop that iterates over different monochromatic photons packages corresponding to a
        single wavelength. The outer loop (over wavelengths) is parallellized. Within the nested
        loops, the function simulates the life cycle of a single stellar photon package. Each
        photon package is born when it is emitted by the stellar system. Immediately after birth,
        peel-off photon packages are created and launched towards the instruments (one for each
        instrument). If there is dust in the system (there usually is...), the photon package now
        enters a cycle which consists of different steps. First, all details of the path of photon
        package through the dust system are calculated and stored. Based on this information, the
        escape and absorption of a fraction of the luminosity of the photon package is simulated.
        When the photon package is still luminous enough, it is propagated to a new scattering
        position, peel-off photon packages are created and launched towards each instrument, and
        the actual scattering is simulated. Then again, the details of the path of photon package
        through the dust system are calculated and stored, and the loop repeats itself. It is
        terminated only when the photon package has lost a very substantial part of its original
        luminosity (and hence becomes irrelevant). */

    /** This function drives the dust self-absorption phase in a panchromatic Monte Carlo
        simulation. This function consists of a big loop, which represents the different cycles of
        the dust self-absorption phase. This outer loop, and the function, terminates when either
        the maximum number of dust self-absorption iterations has been reached (the hardcoded value
        is 100), or when the total luminosity absorbed by the dust is stable and does not change by
        more than 1% compared to the previous cycle. Within every cycle, the first task is to
        construct the dust emission library (an object of the DustEmissionLibrary class) that
        describes the spectral properties of the dust emission. In principle, we should construct a
        separate dust emission library for every dust population in the dust system, but this still
        needs to be implemented. Once the dust emission library is constructed, the dust
        self-absorption phase consists of two nested loops: an outer loop that loops over all
        wavelengths, and an inner loop that iterates over different monochromatic photons packages
        corresponding to a single wavelength. The outer loop (over wavelengths) is parallellized.
        Within the nested loops, the function simulates the life cycle of a single dust photon
        package. Before we can start the life cycle of the photon packages at a given wavelength
        index \f$\ell\f$, we first have to determine the total luminosity that is emitted from
        every dust cell at that wavelength index. This is just the product of the total luminosity
        absorbed in the \f$m\f$'th dust cell, \f$L^{\text{abs}}_m\f$, and the normalized SED at
        wavelength index \f$\ell\f$ corresponding to that cell, as obtained from the dust emission
        library. Once we know the luminosity \f$L_{\ell,m}\f$ emitted by each dust cell, we
        calculate the total dust luminosity, \f[ L_\ell = \sum_{m=0}^{N_{\text{cells}}-1}
        L_{\ell,m}, \f] and create a vector \f$X_m\f$ that describes the normalized cumulative
        luminosity distribution as a function of the cell number \f$m\f$, \f[ X_m = \frac{
        \sum_{m'=0}^m L_{\ell,m'} }{ L_\ell }. \f] This vector is used to generate random dust
        cells from which photon packages can be launched. Now the actual dust self-absorption can
        start, i.e. we launch \f$N_{\text{pp}}\f$ different photon packages at wavelength index
        \f$\ell\f$, with the original position chosen as a random position in the cell \f$m\f$
        chosen randomly from the cumulative luminosity distribution \f$X_m\f$. As we assume that
        there is no scattering for the dust photon packages (an option that could be changed if
        desired) and we don't need to consider peel-off (the dust self-absorption phase is just to
        calculate the internal equilibrium, not to calculate the emergent radiation field), the
        life cycle of a photon in the dust emission phase is extremely simple. First, all details
        of the path of photon package through the dust system are calculated and stored. Based on
        this information, the escape and absorption of a fraction of the luminosity of the photon
        package (i.e. the self-absorption) is simulated. */
