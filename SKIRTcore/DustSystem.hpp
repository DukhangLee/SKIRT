/** DustSystem is an abstract class for representing complete dust systems, including both a dust
    distribution (i.e. a complete description of the spatial distribution and optical properties of
    the dust) and a grid structure on which this distribution is discretized. There are specialized
    subclasses for use with oligochromatic and panchromatic simulations respectively. A DustSystem
    object contains a vector of dust cells, each of which contain all useful information on the
    dust within that particular piece of the configuration space. The type of dust cell is selected
    by the subclass through the factory method createDustCell(). Furthermore, a DustSystem object
    contains pointers a DustDistribution object and to a DustGridStructure object). A subclass
    may of course maintain additional information depending on its needs. */
