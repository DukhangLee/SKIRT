/** The DustGridPath class is a technical class that contains the details of a path through a dust
    grid structure. Given a dust grid structure, i.e. an object of a subclass of the
    DustGridStucture class, a starting position \f${\bf{r}}\f$ and a propagation direction
    \f${\bf{k}}\f$, one can calculate the path through the dust grid structure. A DustGridPath
    object keeps record of all the cells that are crossed by this path, together with the physical
    path length \f$\Delta s\f$ covered within each cell and the path length \f$s\f$ covered along
    the entire path up to the end of the cell. The difference between this class and the
    DustSystemPath class is that the DustGridPath class represents only the geometrical properties
    of a path (i.e. it is only linked to a DustGridStructure class object), whereas the
    DustSystemPath class also records the details on the optical depth (it is linked to a
    DustSystem class object). */

        direction. If the optional \em sizehint is larger than zero, memory space is
        reserved for a path with that size, avoiding the need for reallocating the internal vectors
        as the path grows. The path is still allowed to grow beyond the specified size hint. In any
        case the constructed path is empty (representing a path that lies outside the dust grid

        are added. If the half-ray formed by the initial position and the propagation direction
        does not intersect the box, the function returns some arbitrary position outside the box.
        The small value specified by \em eps is added to the path length beyond the intersection
