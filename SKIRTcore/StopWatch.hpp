/**
This class enables high-resolution timing of code snippets by summing the elapsed time for each
pass through the snippet. The implementation is platform-specific and is currently provided
only for Mac OS X and Linux. The accuracy of the results is affected by the resolution of the
underlying time measurement and by the time needed to start and stop the watch. To achieve
accurate results, the elapsed time between each start/stop sequence should be larger than some
minimum value. These platform-specific quantities are listed in the following table
(approximate times in nanoseconds for a decent desktop computer anno 2012).

The functions in this class are \em not thread-safe and \em not re-entrant. The results are meaningful
only if the application uses just a single execution thread and no other processes consume time
on the computer. Even then interpreting timings is tricky. For example, some modern desktop systems
dynamically change the CPU clock speed depending on the processor's chip temperature, and the
placement of data in memory blocks relative to the processor core in use may substantially affect
performance.

This class offers 5 global (i.e. application-wide) timers numbered from 1 to 5. The timers are
nested, i.e. timer n+1 can only be started when timer n is already running. Vice versa, timer n
can only be stopped when timer n+1 is no longer running. At the start of the application all
timers are initialized to zero and the nesting level is set to zero as well. A call to the
static start() function increments the nesting level and starts the timer corresponding to the
new level. A call to the static stop() function stops the timer corresponding to the current
level and decrements the nesting level. If the nesting level goes out of range, a
fatal error is thrown. To access the timing results, the static report() function returns a
list of strings reporting information on all nonzero timers in a human-readable format.

Rather than explicitly invoking the static start() and stop() functions, an instance of the
StopWatch class can be used to ensure correct nesting of the timings: the constructor simply
calls start() and the destructor calls stop(). For example, to time the execution of a complete
scope, regardless of the scope's exit point, construct a StopWatch instance at the start of the
scope:

\code
{
    StopWatch watch;
    ...
    if (...) return 1;
    else if (...) return 2;
    ...
}
\endcode

The watcher's constructor starts the timer, and its destructor will automatically stop
the timer when the instance goes out of scope.
