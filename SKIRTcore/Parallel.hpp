////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/** This class supports a simple parallel execution model similar to a for loop. The body of the
    for loop consists of the body() function of a ParallelTarget subclass, or alternatively of
    some class member function (specified by the caller) with a single integer argument, which
    gets passed the index of the current iteration.

    For example, to invoke a member function 1000 times one would write something like:
        \code
        void Test::body(size_t index) { ... }
        ...
        ParallelFactory factory;
        factory.parallel()->call(this, &Test::body, 1000);
        \endcode

    A Parallel instance can be created only through the ParallelFactory class. The default
    construction shown above determines a reasonable number of threads for the computer on which
    the code is running, and the call() function distributes the work over these threads.

    The parallelized body should protect (write-) access to shared data through the use of a QMutex
    or QReadWriteLock. Shared data includes the data members of the target object (in the context
    of which the target function executes) and essentially everything other than local variables.
    Also note that the parallelized body includes all functions directly or indirectly called by
    the target function.

    When an exception is thrown by one of the threads excuting the parallelized body, all other
    threads are gracefully shut down and a FatalError exception is thrown in the context of the
    thread that invoked the call() function. If the original exception was a FatalError instance, the
    newly thrown exception is a copy thereof. Otherwise a fresh FatalError instance is created with
    a generic error message.

    Between invocations of the call() function, the parallel threads are put in wait so that
    they consume no CPU cycles (and very little memory). Thus a
    particular Parallel instance can be reused many times for calling various member functions in
    various objects, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying the threads. One can also
    use multiple Parallel instances in an application. For example, a parallelized body can invoke
    the call() function on another Parallel instance that is constructed and destructed within the
    scope of the loop body. Recursively invoking the call() function on the same Parallel instance is
    not allowed and results in undefined behavior.

    The Parallel class uses Qt's multi-threading capabilities, avoiding the complexities of using
    yet another library (such as OpenMP) and making it possible to properly handle exceptions. It
    is designed to minimize the run-time overhead for loops with many iterations. */
