/** The SPHStarburstComp class represents a stellar component consisting of starbursting H II

    simulation. The information on the SPH particles is read from a file formatted as described

    is obtained from the MAPPINGS III starburst template SEDs through the MappingsSEDFamily class.

        a particle from the \f$N\f$ possible particles by generating a random number

        been determined, a position is determined randomly from the smoothed distribution around
        the particle centre, a random propagation direction is determined, and a photon package
        with these properties is constructed and returned. The function assumes the scaled Gaussian
