/** FitScheme is the abstract base class that represents a complete FitSKIRT fit scheme. The class
    inherits SimulationItem so that all functionality built for SKIRT simulation hierarchies
    (including the discovery mechanism) can also be used for fit schemes. A FitScheme instance sits
    at the top of a run-time fit scheme hierarchy (i.e. it has no parent). It holds basic
    attributes including a logging mechanism and a system of units. The constructor provides useful
    defaults for all of these attributes. This is an exception to the rule that all attributes in
    the fit scheme hierarchy must be explicitly set by the caller before invoking setup(). */
