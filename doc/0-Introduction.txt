SKIRT is a state-of-the-art software code for simulating continuum radiation transfer in dusty astrophysical systems,
such as galaxies and accretion disks. SKIRT employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant physical
processes including scattering, absorption and emission by the dust. The code features a wealth of built-in geometries,
light source spectra, dust characterizations, dust grids, and detectors, in addition to various mechanisms for
importing models generated by hydrodynamical simulations. The configuration for a particular simulation is defined
at run-time through a user-friendly (although non-graphical) interface suitable for both occasional and power users.

Specifically, SKIRT:
 - Offers full treatment of multiple anisotropic scattering, absorption and (re-)emission by interstellar dust.
 - Computes the temperature distribution of the dust and the thermal dust re-emission self-consistently,
   even for larger optical depths.
 - Handles any combination of dust mixtures, each with their own spatial distributions, and calculates
   the temperature of different grain size bins individually.
 - Takes into account the stochastic heating of small grains, optionally using an efficient library approach.
 - Handles any 3D geometry without limitation.
 - Includes many built-in components to specify the distribution of stars and dust, and allows importing
   the results of a hydrodynamic simulation.
 - Includes a suite of instruments for measuring the radiation field, mimicking real astronomical
   instrumentation such as imaging and 3D spectroscopic devices.
 - Allows specifying simulation parameters in an interactive console Q&A session and through
   XML-based parameter files.
 - Operates efficiently in both memory consumption and CPU time, using shared memory parallelization.

The SKIRT source tree includes FitSKIRT, an extension of the SKIRT code that automatically fits a 3D model to
observed images of a dusty galaxy. FitSKIRT matches the output frames of SKIRT radiative transfer simulations
to the observed images, searching the model parameter space through a genetic algorithm. For each new individual
constructed by the genetic procedure, FitSKIRT performs a SKIRT simulation using the parameters defined by the
individual's genes. The resulting simulated images are compared with the observed target images, and the result
is fed back into the genetic algorithm as the quality measure for the individual.

The name SKIRT, acronym for Stellar Kinematics Including Radiative Transfer, reflects the code's original use in
studying the effects of dust absorption and scattering on the observed kinematics of elliptical galaxies.
Ironically, the capability to account for the effects of a system's internal kinematics is no longer present
in the current version.

SKIRT is completely written in C++ and has been designed with well-defined programming interfaces between components.
Adding a new feature is usually as simple as adding another class; the user interface automatically adjusts to allow
configuring the new options.

This manual presents the philosophy and capabilities of the SKIRT code. It provides (potential) users
with practical details on how to successfully install and run the code, and how to change it to their personal needs.
This manual contains several parts:
     - The \ref InstallationGuide describes how to install SKIRT on your computer.
     - The \ref UsersGuide explains how to run a SKIRT simulation and what output to expect.
     - The \ref DevelopersGuide offers guidelines on how to extend or adjust the SKIRT code.
     - The Reference part documents every class, namespace and function.
