SKIRT is a radiative transfer code based on the Monte Carlo
technique. The name SKIRT, acronym for Stellar Kinematics Including
Radiative Transfer, reflects the original motivation for its creation:
it has been developed to study the effects of dust absorption and
scattering on the observed kinematics of elliptical galaxies. The
first preliminary versions of SKIRT, which could only handle
one-dimensional spherically symmetric or plane-parallel radiative
transfer problems, were written in the period 2000-2001. These codes
were rather simple and coded in Fortran 77. The first real version of
SKIRT, coded in C++ with the aim to make a more flexible and
sustainable code with a variety of application, was created in 2002.
Since then, the SKIRT code has continuously been extended and improved.

Today SKIRT is a feature-rich code that:
 - Offers full treatment of absorption and multiple anisotropic scattering by interstellar dust.
 - Computes the temperature distribution of the dust and the thermal dust re-emission self-consistently,
   even for large optical depths.
 - Handles different dust mixtures and calculates the temperature of all different grains individually.
 - Takes into account the stochastic heating of small grains using an efficient library approach and a
   coupling to the DustEM library.
 - Handles any 3D geometry without limitation.
 - Includes many built-in components to specify the distribution of stars and dust, and allows importing
   the results of a hydrodynamic simulation.
 - Includes a suite of instruments for measuring the radiation field, mimicking real astronomical
   instrumentation such as imaging and 3D spectroscopic devices.
 - Allows specifying simulation parameters in an interactive console Q&A session and through
   XML-based parameter files.
 - Operates efficiently in both CPU time and memory consumption, as demonstrated by 1D and 2D benchmarks.

Major changes in SKIRT6 (the current version) in comparison to SKIRT5 include the following:
  - SKIRT6 is based on the Qt development environment, optimizing the development process.
  - XML-based parameter files ("ski" files) replace the former plain ASCII format,
    facilitating manual editing and increasing compatibility between future releases.
  - Multiple simulations can be executed in parallel within the same application.
  - Performance has been improved in several areas.

This manual is meant to give an up-to-date overview of the philosophy
and capabilities of the SKIRT code and to provide potential users
with practical details on how to successfully install, run and change the
code to their personal needs. This manual contains several parts:
     - The \ref InstallationGuide describes how to install SKIRT on your computer.
     - The \ref UsersGuide explains how to run a SKIRT simulation and what output to expect.
     - The \ref DevelopersGuide offers guidelines on how to extend or adjust the SKIRT code.
     - The Reference part documents every class, namespace and function.
