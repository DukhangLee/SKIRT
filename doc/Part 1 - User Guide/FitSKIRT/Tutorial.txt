\page FS_Tutorial Tutorial: NGC4013

In this section we show a step-by-step setup for a FitSKIRT fit using a flattened Sersic profile for the central bulge
and double exponential for the stellar disk and dust disk will be constructed. The data used in this tutorial is
available from the <a href="http://www.skirt.ugent.be/downloads.html">downloads page</a>. The first step consists of starting a <tt>SKIRT</tt> Q&A session,
creating the \em ski file and adjusting it afterwards. The second step is to create a suitable \em fksi file. The final steps
shows how to run the code and what output to expect.

\section SKIRT-template

For simplicity we will only use the u and g band data in this tutorial. The addition of extra frames is done using the
exact same procedure as described here. Create a new directory and copy the two reference frames and start a <tt>SKIRT</tt> Q&A
session.

\verbatim
mkdir NGC4013
cd NGC4013/
mkdir reference
cp ../tutorial_NGC4013_complete/u_norm.fits ./reference/u.fits
cp ../tutorial_NGC4013_complete/g_norm.fits ./reference/g.fits
skirt
\endverbatim

Go through the session as you would do for a regular SKIRT simulation (See the SKIRT tutorial for more information).
However, keep in mind that you need to select an OligoMonteCarloSimulation and a MultiFrameInstrument. Apart from the
flag to write out the separate stellar components, it is adviseable to set all flags to False. Use 0.354 and 0.475
micron as central wavelengths for the u and g band images and try to run the file just using SKIRT to see if any error
pops up. When everything looks like you expect it to look, open the .ski file in your favorite XML editor. Now look for
the free parameters, place them in square brackets and give them an approriate label. For example look for the following
lines

\verbatim
<MultiFrameInstrument instrumentName="lol" distance="10 Mpc" inclination="90 deg"
<ExpDiskGeometry radialScale="4400 pc" axialScale="500 pc"
<SpheroidalGeometry flattening="0.5">
<SersicGeometry index="2.5" radius="2500 pc"/>
<ExpDiskGeometry radialScale="6600 pc" axialScale="250 pc"
<DustMassDustCompNormalization dustMass="4e7 Msun"/>
\endverbatim

and replace them by this

\verbatim
<MultiFrameInstrument instrumentName="lol" distance="10 Mpc" inclination="[inclination:90 deg]"
<ExpDiskGeometry radialScale="[stellar_length:4400 pc]" axialScale="[stellar_height:500 pc]"
<SpheroidalGeometry flattening="[flattening:0.5]">
<SersicGeometry index="[sersic_index:2.5]" radius="[bulge_radius:2500 pc]"/>
<ExpDiskGeometry radialScale="[dust_length:6600 pc]" axialScale="[dust_height:250 pc]"
<DustMassDustCompNormalization dustMass="[dust_mass:4e7 Msun]"/>
\endverbatim

Notice that the luminosities, although also fitted by FitSKIRT should not be put in brackets. Instead the value that is
put in is a dummy value used to create the simulations before determining the best fitting luminosity. Once all free
parameters have been put in brackets and labelled, start a FitSKIRT Q&A session.

\section FitSKIRT

Start the creation of a new .fski file simply by typing "fitskirt", select the same unit options as you did in the SKIRT
file.

\verbatim
Welcome to FitSKIRT v7 (git 109-fbb9c3b-dirty built on Oct 21 2014 at 11:13:01)
Interactively constructing a fit scheme...
Enter the name of the fski file to be created: tutorial
Possible choices for the fit scheme:
   1. An oligochromatic fit scheme
Automatically selected the only choice: 1
Possible choices for the units system:
   1. SI units
   2. Stellar units (length in AU, distance in pc)
   3. Extragalactic units (length in pc, distance in Mpc)
Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (3):
Possible choices for the output style for flux density and surface brightness:
   1. Neutral: lambda F_lambda = nu F_nu

\endverbatim

Notice that the only available option at this point is to construct a fit using an adjustable SKIRT simulation. Next
fill in the name (or path) to the ski file you have created and adjusted in the previous step, in this case 
"2comp.ski"

\verbatim
Enter the name of the ski file specifying the SKIRT simulation: 2comp.ski
\endverbatim

Next choose for the random seed and start entering the free parameters.
The example below shows one example for the physical quantity, Position angle.

\verbatim
Do you want to Do you want a fixed seed (only for testing purposes)? [yes/no] (no):
Possible choices for the parameter ranges:
   1. A list of parameter ranges
Automatically selected the only choice: 1
Possible choices for item #1 in the parameter ranges list:
   1. A parameter range
Automatically selected the only choice: 1
Enter the label identifying this parameter range: inclination
Possible choices for the type of physical quantity represented by this parameter range:

\endverbatim

Make sure to include the other free parameters, giving them appropriate quantities and ranges. Notice that a Distance
parameter is not used in this case, it simply there for completeness. It is advisable to insert the parameters ranges in
a logical order as the same order will be used to create the output files.

Next insert the relative paths to the reference images, PSF FWHM and lumonisity boundaries. The luminosity boundaries
should be set relative to the dummy value you have entered.

\verbatim
Possible choices for the refence images:
   1. A list of images
Automatically selected the only choice: 1

   1. A reference image
Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,1] (1): 0
\endverbatim

The last step is to setup the genetic algorithm parameters. In this case it is advisable to use a population of 200
individuals and evaluate them for 100 generations. The mutation probability and crossover rate can be set to the
standard values.

\verbatim
Possible choices for the optimization properties:
   1. The optimization setup
Automatically selected the only choice: 1
Enter the number of individuals in the population [0,1000] (100): 200
Enter the number of generations to be evaluated  [0,1000] (100): 100
Enter the mutation probability [0,1] (0.03):
Enter the crossover rate [0,1] (0.65):
Successfully created fski file 'tutorial.fski'.
To run the fit use the command: fitskirt tutorial

\section Results

First of all make sure skirt can run your ski file without error. It should just ignore the square brackets and use the
default values. You should only continue if this runs without errors.

In case you want to see if you get the exact same output as this section you should open both the ski and fski file in a
text editor. In the ski file make sure you set the random see to 4357 and lower the amount of photon packages to 1e4.
Notice that this is just a test run and the output should not be considered as a good fitting run. Your actual run
should need more of everything (photon packages, individuals ,...) In the fksi file set the random seed to fixed, change
the populationsize to 10 and the number of generations to 5 and set the same boundaries for your free parameters. Below
you can find the complete fski file.

Then run fitskirt using the following flags to run using one processor and write the output to a separate folder.

\verbatim
mkdir sample_output
fitskirt -t 1 tutorial.fski -o ./sample_output
\endverbatim

You should then get the following output (apart from the elapsed time and version stamp):

Notice that the output directory now contains 22 files. Because FitSKIRT can create a huge amount of output, it only
keeps the best fitting frames and deletes any additional files. However, the tutorial_allsimulations.dat files keeps all
relevant information about all the performed radiative transfer models. The first digit of the line is the generation
number. The following number are the parameter values for that model in the same order as they are given in the .fski
file. Next is the total chi2-value, the luminosity at the first wavelength (u-band) of the first and second component,
the luminosity at the second wavelength (g-band) of the first and second component, the chi2-value at the first and
second component, all respectively in that order.

tutorial_BESTsimulations.dat (see below) contains only the simulations which, at that point, were the best fitting
models. The model on the first line is therefore the first radiative transfer model done, because by definition it was
the best model at that point. The last line gives you the final solution. As this is not the clearest way to get an
overview of your run, make sure to look at the fitskirt_results.py script that comes with the PTS toolkit (see
http://www.skirt.ugent.be/pts/_fit_s_k_i_r_t_guide.html).

The best fitting models are given as tutorial_Best_X_Y.fits where X corresponds to the best fitting solution in
tutorial_BESTsimulations.dat and Y is the wavelength (in this case 0 being u-band and 1 being g-band). These frames are
adjusted to the correct luminosity, convolved with the correct beam and have the same masked regions as the reference
frames. Additionally a corresponding residual frame is created, tutorial_Residual_X_Y.fits, defined as
abs(reference_frame - tutorial_Best_X_Y.fits)/abs(reference_frame).

As a final comparison open tutorial_BESTsimulations.dat file. If you have used the exact same values as mentioned here
you should get the following content:

\verbatim

\endverbatim

So in this case your best fitting model is on the fifth line and can be seen in tutorial_Best_4_0.fits and
tutorial_Best_4_1.fits and corresponding residuals. Again notice that this is not a representative case of a good fit
and should only be used in the context of this tutorial. If you want to make an actual fit of this galaxy, put off the
fixed seed, change your photon packages to about 5e5, your populationsize to 200 and 100 generations. Also run your
simulation using more than 1 thread or use mpi to run fitskirt. However, this fit will run much much longer and is not
useful to quickly test your results.

Also notice that, although this tutorial was based on an edge-on spiral galaxy it is not limited to this case. Feel free
to choose any free parameters or models which suit your case.
