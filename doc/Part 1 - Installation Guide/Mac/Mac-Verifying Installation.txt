<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Add the SKIRT release directory to your path. </b>

  - In Terminal, type:

        cd [ENTER]
        open ~/.bash_profile [ENTER]

  - If you get the following warning:

        The file /Users/yourname/.bash_profile does not exist.

    go to the next step. If a file opens in your text editor, skip the next step.

<b> Create a .bash_profile </b>

  - Open the default text editor (TextEdit) in OS X and create a new blank text document.
  - Under the 'Format' menu, select 'Make Plain Text'.

  - Type the following line:

        export PATH=~/SKIRT/release/SKIRTmain:~/SKIRT/release/FitSKIRTmain:$PATH

  - Next, save the file. In the popup window, do as follows:

    - As name, type: .bash_profile
    - As the location, select your home folder (yourname)
    - UNCHECK the box before 'Use '.txt' if no extension is used.

    \image html makebashprofile.jpeg
	\image latex makebashprofile.jpeg

  - If you press 'Save', you will get a warning similar to:

        Only the system can use names starting with a dot (.).

    Press "Use ." anyway.

  - Skip the next step.

<b> Modify the .bash_profile file. </b>

  - Add the following line to your .bash_profile:

        export PATH=~/SKIRT/release/SKIRTmain:~/SKIRT/release/FitSKIRTmain:$PATH

  - Next, save the file and go to the final step.

<b> Testing everything out. </b>

  - Close any open Terminal window.
  - Launch a new Terminal window.
  - Type:

        skirt [ENTER]
	
  - If you see the following messages:

    \image html skirtinteractive.jpeg
	\image latex skirtinteractive.jpeg

    your SKIRT installation has succeeded. You can either follow the instructions in the Terminal window to create a ski (skirt simulation) file or press [CTRL] + C to exit the program. 
   
  - To get information about how you can use SKIRT, you can type 'skirt -h', which will yield the following output:
   
   \image html skirthelp.jpeg
   \image latex skirthelp.jpeg

  - You can also proceed with the \ref UsersGuide or \ref FSUsersGuide.
