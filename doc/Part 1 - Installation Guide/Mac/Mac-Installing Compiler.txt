\page InstallMacComp Installing the compiler

<tt>SKIRT</tt> is written in C++11, the C++ flavor that was standardized in 2011, extending the language with new features.
Hence you need to install a recent C++ compiler.
On Mac OS X this is accomplished by installing the Xcode development environment, which is
freely available from the App Store. Download and install the latest version, and then launch the Xcode application
at least once to complete installation. You should see the startup screen shown below. <tt>SKIRT</tt> was tested with Xcode 6.1 which installs the Apple C++ compiler Clang (Apple LLVM version 6.0 based on LLVM 3.5svn).

\note It is important that you launch the Xcode application at least once to complete installation
of the command line tools that will be used by the Qt development environment.

\note You need to install the full Xcode application; installing the <em>Command Line Tools for Xcode</em> package
is not sufficient (and not needed).
