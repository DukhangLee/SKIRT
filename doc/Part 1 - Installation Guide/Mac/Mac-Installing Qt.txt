\page InstallMacQt Installing the Qt development environment

<tt>SKIRT</tt> is based on the Qt 5.3 development environment (but also works with Qt 5.2). 
In addition to run-time libraries and build tools, Qt offers
a convenient integrated code editor called Qt Creator. All of these components can be installed on Mac OS X with
a single installer.

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Download the binaries for OS X </b>

  - Go to the <a href="http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/">Qt download page</a>.
  - Click on "Qt Offline Installers" on the middle of the page.
  - Find "Qt 5.3.2 for Mac (456 MB)" under "OS X Host" and download it.

<b> Open the installer </b>

  - Open the '.dmg' file that you just downloaded to mount the installation disk.
  - When the mounting has finished, the following Finder window will appear:
  
    \image html qtinstaller.png
	\image latex qtinstaller.png

  - Double-click on the installer and follow the instructions. Leave the default settings.
  - At the end of the installation, you can choose to open Qt Creator (see: \ref InstallMacBuildQtCreator), but you don't need to.

<b> Configure the installation for Mac OS X 10.9 and 10.10 </b>

  - Navigate to the installation folder: "yourname > Qt5.3.2 > 5.3 > clang_64 > mkspecs"

	\image latex qtmkspecspath.jpeg

  - Open the file 'qdevice.pri' with the default text editor (right click -> Open with.. -> Other.. and find TextEdit) or any other preferred editor.
  - Change the following line:

        !host_build:QMAKE_MAC_SDK = macosx10.8
		
	so that it states the version number for your system (10.9 for Mavericks and 10.10 for Yosemite). The screenshot below shows the modified file for OS X Yosemite:
	
	\image html pribestand.png
	\image latex pribestand.png

  - Save the file.
  - If Qt Creator is open, restart it.

<b> Make a shortcut to Qt Creator </b> 

  - Use Finder or Spotlight to locate the \em Qt \em Creator application in the newly installed directory,
    and drag the application icon to your dock (or add it to your preferred application launcher).
