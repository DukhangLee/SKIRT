\page InstallMacGetDevelop Getting the SKIRT source code (for developers)

If you plan to make code contributions, there are two possibilities:

- You can \ref InstallMacGetDevelopPublic (if you don't have a UGent account)
- You can \ref InstallMacGetDevelopPrivate (if you have a UGent account)

\section InstallMacGetDevelopPublic Use the public SKIRT code

The public <tt>SKIRT</tt>code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a> and always represents the most stable and thoroughly tested version of SKIRT. 
Despite not being the latest development version, developers without a UGent account are greatly encouraged to use this version as a starting point for their own contributions.
This process is effortless due to the strength of the git tool and the GitHub website. 

To setup a local repository and start developing (and using) <tt>SKIRT</tt> without a UGent account, follow the instructions below.

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Make a GitHub account </b>

 - If you already have an account on the <a href="https://github.com">GitHub website</a>, log yourself in and skip the rest of this step.
 - Visit the <a href="https://github.com">GitHub website</a> and fill in your e-mail adress and a newly chosen username and password. 
 - Press "Sign up for GitHub". 
 - On the next page, press "Finish sign up".
 - You will receive an e-mail with a confirmation link. Go to the corresponding webpage and press "Confirm".
 - Stay logged in for the next step.

<b> Fork the SKIRT repository </b>

 - In the search bar on top of the page, type <tt>SKIRT [ENTER]</tt> to find the <tt>SKIRT</tt> repository.
 - Click on the repository that is listed as "SKIRT/SKIRT".
 - In the top right corner of the page, press "Fork" (see the screenshot below).
 - Your are immediately brought to a new repository "username/SKIRT", which is - at that moment - an exact clone of the original "SKIRT/SKIRT" repository.

<b> Configure git </b>

- Before using the git client, you should configure it with your user name and email address. This is especially important if you plan to contribute code to the <tt>SKIRT</tt>repository. 
  Perform the following commands in a Terminal window, replacing the placeholders with your own name and email address:

      git config --global user.name "Your Name" [ENTER]
      git config --global user.email "yourname@organization.org" [ENTER]
	  
<b> Clone your <tt>SKIRT</tt>fork to your computer </b>

 - In a Terminal window, type the following:
 
       cd [ENTER]
       mkdir <tt>SKIRT</tt>[ENTER]
       cd <tt>SKIRT</tt>[ENTER]
       mkdir debug doc release run git [ENTER]

 - Back on your "username/SKIRT" repository, find the "Copy to clipboard" option on the right of the page (see the screenshot below). 
 - Make sure it states "HTTPS" above the text box, before copying the link to the clipboard.

 - Go back to Terminal and type the following commands:
 
       cd [ENTER]
       cd <tt>SKIRT</tt>[ENTER]
       git clone [PASTE] git [ENTER]

   where [PASTE] is to be replaced with [CMD] + [V] on Mac and [CTRL] + [SHIFT] + [V] on Ubuntu. The last command thus looks as follows:
   
       git clone https://github.com/username/SKIRT.git git

   \note Don't forget to add the extra "git" at the end of the last line!
   
 - You now have your forked repository cloned to your computer, where you can begin modifying it (see the \ref DevelopersGuide).

\section InstallMacGetDevelopPrivate Use the private <tt>SKIRT</tt>code

The current development version of the <tt>SKIRT</tt>source code is stored in a \em private GitHub repository hosted
on the Ghent University's web servers. You can access this repository only if you have a UGent account \em and
the core <tt>SKIRT</tt>team has specifically granted you read-only or read/write access rights to the repository.

If you have a UGent account and the core <tt>SKIRT</tt>team has granted you access rights to the <tt>SKIRT</tt>repository, use the instructions below to obtain the <tt>SKIRT</tt>source code. 

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Configure git </b>

- Before using the git client, you should configure it with your user name and email address. This is especially important if you plan to contribute code to the <tt>SKIRT</tt>repository. 
  Perform the following commands in a Terminal window, replacing the placeholders with your own name and email address:

      git config --global user.name "Your Name" [ENTER]
      git config --global user.email "yourname@organization.org" [ENTER]

<b> Check for existing keys </b>

- Type the following in a Terminal window:

      ls -al ~/.ssh [ENTER]

- If there is a key with extension '.pub' present, skip the next step.

<b> Generate a SSH key </b>

- Again in the Terminal window, type:

      cd [ENTER]
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "yourname@organization.org" [ENTER]
      [ENTER]

- Type a new password and press [ENTER]
- Type this password again and press [ENTER]
- You should see the following output:

      Your identification has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa.
      Your public key has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
      The key fingerprint is:
      XX:XX:XX:XX:XX ... yourname@organization.org
      The key's randomart image is:
      +--[ RSA 2048]----+
      |                 |
      |          XX     |
      |       X XX   X  |
      |         X   XX  |
      |       X XX   X  |
      |         XX XX   |
      |                 |
      |           X     |
      |                 |
      +-----------------+

<b> Add your new key to the ssh-agent </b>

- Type the following in Terminal:

      eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" [ENTER]

- You should see the following output:

      Agent pid XXXXX

- Type:

      ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa [ENTER]

- You wil see the following output:

      Enter passphrase for /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa:
	
- Enter your password and press [ENTER].
- You will see the following output:

      Identity added: /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa)

<b> Add the SSH key to your github.ugent account </b>

- Navigate to github.ugent.be and log in.
- Click on your username (top right).
- Click on 'Edit profile' (top right).
- Go to 'SSH keys'.
- Press 'Add SSH key'.
- As the Title, enter something that identifies your computer (for example: Personal MacBook).
- Go back to the terminal and copy your SSH key by typing:

      pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [ENTER]

- Back on the website, paste ([cmd] + V) in the 'Key' text field.
- Click 'Add key'.
- After adding your key, you should wait about 10 minutes before continuing with the next step.

<b> Clone the private repository </b>

- In Terminal, type:

      cd [ENTER]
      cd <tt>SKIRT</tt>[ENTER]
      git clone ...

- You will see the following output:

      The authenticity of host 'github.ugent.be (XXX.XXX.XXX.XX)' can't be established. 
      RSA key fingerprint is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX ... .
      Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 

- Type:

      yes [ENTER]

- You will see different kinds of output.
- To update your local copy of the source code after changes were made to the repository from which you cloned it, use:

      cd ~/SKIRT/git [ENTER]
      git pull [ENTER]
