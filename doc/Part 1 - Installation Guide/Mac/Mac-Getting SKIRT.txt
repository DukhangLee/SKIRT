\page InstallMacGetPublic Getting the SKIRT source code

To work with SKIRT, you need to copy the source code to your local file system. First create a directory hierarchy that
will hold the <tt>SKIRT</tt>source code, binaries and run-time information. The top-level directory can have any name (for
example \c SKIRT) and can be located anywhere, but the subdirectories should be named as indicated below. Execute the following commands in a Terminal 
window to create the <tt>SKIRT</tt> directory in your home folder.

\verbatim
cd [ENTER]
mkdir SKIRT [ENTER]
cd SKIRT [ENTER]
mkdir debug doc release run git [ENTER]
\endverbatim

The most recent stable version of the <tt>SKIRT</tt> source code is available from the
<a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/SKIRT">public <tt>SKIRT</tt> GitHub repository</a> at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>.
While any user can freely retrieve the code from this repository (even anonymously), only the core <tt>SKIRT</tt> team
has write access to it.

If you just want to use the stable version of <tt>SKIRT</tt> without making any code contributions, you can simply clone
the public repository as an anonymous user:

\verbatim
cd ~/SKIRT [ENTER]
git clone https://github.com/SKIRT/SKIRT.git git [ENTER]
\endverbatim

This command will produce different kinds of output.
