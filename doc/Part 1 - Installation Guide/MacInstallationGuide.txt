\page InstallMac Installing and developing SKIRT on Mac OS X

This section explains how to install and configure the complete development environment for SKIRT on
Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) including the capability to generate HTML and PDF documentation for SKIRT.
Mac OS X is written on top of a Unix system (\em not Linux) customized by Apple. This means that most of the standard
Unix tools are available, but things are sufficiently different to warrant a separate treatment.

Some of the installation steps described below require you to enter Unix shell commands in a Terminal window.
In most cases, you will need to be or become super-user (for example using \c sudo \c bash) for the commands
to run successfully.

If you only want to install SKIRT for your radiative transfer problems without adding modifications to the source code, read through sections:

- \ref InstallMacComp
- \ref InstallMacQt
- \ref InstallMacGetPublic
- \ref InstallMacBuildNoQtCreator
- \ref InstallMacVerify

For setting SKIRT up for development and building, follow the instructions in:

- \ref InstallMacComp 
- \ref InstallMacQt
- \ref InstallMacGetDevelop
- \ref InstallMacConfigQt 
- \ref InstallMacBuildQtCreator
- \ref InstallMacVerify
- \ref InstallMacDoxStyle
- \ref InstallMacDoxygen
