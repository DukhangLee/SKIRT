\page InstallMacGetDevelop Getting the SKIRT source code (for developers)

If you plan to make code contributions, there are two possibilities:

- You can use the public SKIRT code (if you don't have a UGent account)
- You can use the private SKIRT code (if you have a UGent account)

In the first case, you should create an account at
<a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>,
fork the <a href="https://github.com/SKIRT/SKIRT">SKIRT repository</a> and then clone your own fork to your computer.
This allows you to push your modifications to your own fork and initiate a pull request when you want to contribute
the changes to the project. Refer to the online GitHub documentation for more information about this process. 

The other option is to use the the current development version of the SKIRT source code, stored in a \em private GitHub repository hosted
on the Ghent University's web servers. You can access this repository only if you have a UGent account \em and
the core SKIRT team has specifically granted you read-only or read/write access rights to the repository.

If you have a UGent account and the core SKIRT team has granted you access rights to the SKIRT repository, use the instructions below to obtain the SKIRT source code. 

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

<b> Configure git </b>

- Before using the git client, you should configure it with your user name and email address. This is especially important if you plan to contribute code to the SKIRT repository. 
  Perform the following commands in a Terminal window, replacing the placeholders with your own name and email address:

      git config --global user.name "Your Name" [ENTER]
      git config --global user.email "yourname@organization.org" [ENTER]

<b> Check for existing keys </b>

- Type the following in a Terminal window:

      ls -al ~/.ssh [ENTER]

- If there is a key with extension '.pub' present, skip the next step.

<b> Generate a SSH key </b>

- Again in the Terminal window, type:

      cd [ENTER]
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "yourname@organization.org" [ENTER]
      [ENTER]

- Type a new password and press [ENTER]
- Type this password again and press [ENTER]
- You should see the following output:

      Your identification has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa.
      Your public key has been saved in /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
      The key fingerprint is:
      XX:XX:XX:XX:XX ... yourname@organization.org
      The key's randomart image is:
      +--[ RSA 2048]----+
      |                 |
      |          XX     |
      |       X XX   X  |
      |         X   XX  |
      |       X XX   X  |
      |         XX XX   |
      |                 |
      |           X     |
      |                 |
      +-----------------+

<b> Add your new key to the ssh-agent </b>

- Type the following in Terminal:

      eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" [ENTER]

- You should see the following output:

      Agent pid XXXXX

- Type:

      ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa [ENTER]

- You wil see the following output:

      Enter passphrase for /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa:
	
- Enter your password and press [ENTER].
- You will see the following output:

      Identity added: /Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/yourname/.ssh/id_rsa)

<b> Add the SSH key to your github.ugent account </b>

- Navigate to github.ugent.be and log in.
- Click on your username (top right).
- Click on 'Edit profile' (top right).
- Go to 'SSH keys'.
- Press 'Add SSH key'.
- As the Title, enter something that identifies your computer (for example: Personal MacBook).
- Go back to the terminal and copy your SSH key by typing:

      pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [ENTER]

- Back on the website, paste ([cmd] + V) in the 'Key' text field.
- Click 'Add key'.
- After adding your key, you should wait about 10 minutes before continuing with the next step.

<b> Clone the private repository </b>

- In Terminal, type:

      cd [ENTER]
      cd SKIRT [ENTER]
      git clone ...

- You will see the following output:

      The authenticity of host 'github.ugent.be (XXX.XXX.XXX.XX)' can't be established. 
      RSA key fingerprint is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX ... .
      Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 

- Type:

      yes [ENTER]

- You will see different kinds of output.
- To update your local copy of the source code after changes were made to the repository from which you cloned it, use:

      cd ~/SKIRT/git [ENTER]
      git pull [ENTER]
