\section InstallMacConf Configuring the Qt development environment

Before proceeding, you should configure Qt Creator according to the following instructions.
Launch the Qt Creator application if necessary, and choose the "Qt Creator->Preferences..." menu item to open
the preferences panel. On the various tabs listed below, make the specified adjustments (leaving all other
settings untouched), and at the end press the OK button to confirm the changes.

<i> Step-by-step instructions: </i>

- Launch the Qt Creator application and choose the "Qt Creator->Preferences..." menu item to open the preferences dialog.

- Select the "Build&Run->Compilers" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the Clang compiler installed on your
    computer. If not, manually add a suitable compiler and press the "Apply" button.

- Select the "Build&Run->Qt Versions" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the Qt version you just installed
    (Qt 5.2.1 if you used the installer mentioned above). If not, manually add an appropriate Qt version.

- Select the "Build&Run->Kits" tab. Remove any lines listed other than "Desktop (Default)" (select each of the
    lines in turn and press the "Remove" button). Select the line "Desktop (Default)" and verify and/or configure
    its properties: "Compiler" should be "Clang x86 64-bit", and "Qt version" should be the version you installed
    (i.e. Qt 5.2.1 if you used the installer mentioned above).

	  the doc folder in your main SKIRT directory (yourname/SKIRT/doc) and add it to the documentation available in Qt Creator.

- "C++ -> Code Style" tab
    - press the "Import..." button, select the file <tt>~/SKIRT/git/doc/SkirtCodeStyle.xml</tt>
      and press the "Open" button

    - Save all files before build: On
    - Open Compile Output pane when building: On
    - Clear old application output on a new run: On
    - Merge stderr and stdout: On

\section InstallMacBuild Building SKIRT with Qt Creator

To build SKIRT from within Qt Creator, you need to open the main Qt project included with the source code.
In Qt Creator, choose the menu item "File->Open File or Project...", locate the Qt project
file \c BuildSKIRT.pro inside your \c SKIRT/git directory, and press the "Open" button from within the dialog.

Qt Creator now opens a configuration pane for the BuildSKIRT project in its main window. Simply press the
"Configure Project..." button without changing any of the values, which causes Qt Creator to switch to
regular "Edit" mode. However you still need to adjust the project configuration.

Select "Projects" mode in the left margin and select the "Build & Run" tab. There should be two subtabs called
"Build" and "Run", placed under a "Desktop" header stating your Qt and compiler version. First select the "Build" subtab. There are two build
configurations called "Debug" and "Release", which can be selected through the "Edit build configuration" popup.
For each configuration, change the "Build directory" to one of the directories you created earlier
(\c SKIRT/debug for the debug configuration, \c SKIRT/release for the release configuration).

Still in "Projects" mode, now select the "Run" subtab. In the "Run configuration" popup, select the
"SKIRTmain" item. Now change the "Working directory" to the \c SKIRT/run directory
you created earlier. Turn off the "Run in terminal" option;
this causes SKIRT's log messages to appear inside Qt Creator rather than in a separate Terminal window.

Finally go back to "Edit" mode (icon in left margin). Here you can browse, view and edit the source tree.
To compile and build the complete SKIRT code (including FitSKIRT), click the hammer icon in the left margin.
