\page InstallUbuntuQt Installing the Qt development environment

SKIRT is based on the Qt 5.3 development environment, but also supports Qt 5.2. In addition to run-time libraries and build tools, Qt offers
a convenient integrated code editor called Qt Creator. All of these components can be installed on Ubuntu with
a single installer.

<i>Step-by-step instructions:</i>

<b>Download the Qt installer</b>

 - Go to the <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt download page</a> and click on "Show Downloads" on the bottom of the page. 
 - Click on "Qt 5.3.2 for Linux 64-bit (447 MB)" and press "Save File" to download the installer for linux. 

<b>Run the installer</b>

 - Before you can run the file, you should make it executable by opening a Terminal window and typing the following commands:

       cd
       cd Downloads
       chmod +rx qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.3.2.run
       ./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.3.2.run

 - Follow the instructions in the installer wizard for a standard install. Qt will be installed to your home directory (/home/yourname).
 - When the download is finished, don't launch Qt Creator just yet (uncheck the box at the end).
 
<b>Add Qt Creator to the launcher</b>

 - Locate the Qt installation folder. If you followed the steps above, it should be called "Qt5.3.2" and be located in your home directory.
 - In the Qt directory, navigate to Tools > QtCreator > bin.
 - Double-click on the executable "qtcreator". The Qt Creator window will pop up.
 - In the launcher, right-click on the Qt icon and select "Lock to Launcher" to maintain a shortcut to Qt Creator.
