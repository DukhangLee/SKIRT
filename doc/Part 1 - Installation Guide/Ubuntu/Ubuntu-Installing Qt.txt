\page InstallUbuntuQt Installing the Qt development environment

<tt>SKIRT</tt> is based on the Qt 5.4 development environment (but also works with Qt 5.3 and 5.2). In addition to run-time libraries and build tools, Qt offers
a convenient integrated code editor called Qt Creator. All of these components can be installed on Ubuntu with
a single installer.

<i>Step-by-step instructions:</i>

<b>Download the Qt installer</b>

 - Go to the <a href="http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/">Qt download page</a> and click on "Qt Offline Installers" on the middle of the page. 
 - Under "Linux Host", click on "Qt 5.4.0 for Linux 64-bit (542 MB)" and press "Save File" to download the installer for linux. 

<b>Run the installer</b>

 - Before you can run the file, you should make it executable by opening a Terminal window and typing the following commands:

       cd [ENTER]
       cd Downloads [ENTER]
       chmod +rx qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.4.0.run [ENTER]
       ./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.4.0.run [ENTER]

 - Follow the instructions in the installer wizard. If you enter the "Select Components" screen, uncheck the "Qt WebEngine" and "Qt Extras" components (see screenshot).

 - When the installation is finished, don't launch Qt Creator just yet (uncheck the box at the end).
 
<b>Add Qt Creator to the launcher</b>

 - Locate the Qt installation folder. If you followed the steps above, it should be called "Qt5.4.0" and be located in your home directory.
 - In the Qt directory, navigate to Tools > QtCreator > bin.
 - Double-click on the executable "qtcreator". The Qt Creator window will pop up.
 - In the launcher, right-click on the Qt icon and select "Lock to Launcher" to maintain a shortcut to Qt Creator.
