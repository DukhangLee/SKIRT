\page InstallUbuntuBuildQtCreator Building SKIRT with Qt Creator

To build <tt>SKIRT</tt> from within Qt Creator, you need to open the main Qt project included with the source code.
In Qt Creator, choose the menu item "File->Open File or Project...", locate the Qt project
file \c BuildSKIRT.pro inside your \c SKIRT/git directory, and press the "Open" button from within the dialog.

Qt Creator now opens a configuration pane for the BuildSKIRT project in its main window. Simply press the
"Configure Project..." button without changing any of the values, which causes Qt Creator to switch to
regular "Edit" mode. However you still need to adjust the project configuration.

Select "Projects" mode in the left margin and select the "Build & Run" tab. There should be two subtabs called
"Build" and "Run", placed under a "Desktop" header stating your Qt and compiler version. First select the "Build" subtab. There are two build
configurations called "Debug" and "Release", which can be selected through the "Edit build configuration" popup.
For each configuration, change the "Build directory" to one of the directories you created earlier
(\c SKIRT/debug for the debug configuration, \c SKIRT/release for the release configuration).

Still in "Projects" mode, now select the "Run" subtab. In the "Run configuration" popup, select the
"SKIRTmain" item. Now change the "Working directory" to the \c SKIRT/run directory
you created earlier. Turn off the "Run in terminal" option;
this causes SKIRT's log messages to appear inside Qt Creator rather than in a separate Terminal window.

Finally go back to "Edit" mode (icon in left margin). Here you can browse, view and edit the source tree.
To compile and build the complete <tt>SKIRT</tt> code (including <tt>FitSKIRT</tt>), click the hammer icon in the left margin.
