\page InstallSrcBuild Building SKIRT

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> source code includes a shell script \c makeSKIRT.sh to assist in building <tt>SKIRT</tt>
from the source code in the git directory. If the Qt tools and libraries were not installed in one of the default places, 
you will need to adjust the path to \c qmake in the script. Also, before you use the script for the first time, you may need
to make it executable.

To build <tt>SKIRT</tt>, type the following commands:

    cd ~/SKIRT/git [ENTER]
    chmod +rx makeSKIRT.sh [ENTER]
    ./makeSKIRT.sh [ENTER]
