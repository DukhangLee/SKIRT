\page InstallUbuntu Installing and developing SKIRT on Ubuntu Desktop

This section explains how to install and configure the development environment for SKIRT on Ubuntu Desktop 14.04,
one of the most popular Linux distributions. At this time there are no
instructions for generating SKIRT documentation on Ubuntu, although this should be possible if the need arises.

Some of the installation steps described below require you to enter Unix shell commands in a Terminal window.
In most cases, you will need to be or become super-user (for example using \c sudo \c bash) for the commands
to run successfully.

\section InstallUbuPacks Installing development tools

SKIRT is written in C++11, the C++ flavor that was standardized in 2011, extending the language with new features.
The SKIRT source code resides in an online GitHub repository, which you can access from your computer
through the \c git client. Hence you need to install a recent C++ compiler and the \c git client.

On Ubuntu you can accomplish this easily by installing the appropriate packages using the standard package manager.
From a Terminal window, simply enter:

\verbatim
apt-get install g++
apt-get install git
\endverbatim

\section InstallUbuGit Configuring the source control client

Before using the \c git client, you should configure it with your user name and email address. This is
especially important if you plan to contribute code to the SKIRT repository. Perform the following commands,
replacing the placeholders with your own name and email address:

\verbatim
git config --global user.name "John Smith"
git config --global user.email john.smith@smithsonian.org
\endverbatim

\section InstallUbuQt Installing the Qt development environment

SKIRT is based on the Qt 5.2 development environment. In addition to run-time libraries and build tools, Qt offers
a convenient integrated code editor called Qt Creator. All of these components can be installed on Ubuntu with
a single installer.

Go to the <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt download page</a> and download the file called
\c qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.2.1.run . Make the downloaded file executable and run it as follows:

\verbatim
chmod +rx qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.2.1.run
./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.2.1.run
\endverbatim

Follow the instructions in the installer wizard for a standard install.
Once the installation completed, locate and launch the Qt Creator application.
Choose the "Tools->Options..." menu item to open the options dialog.

Select the "Build&Run->Compilers" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the gcc compiler installed on your
computer. If not, manually add a suitable compiler and press the "Apply" button.
Select the "Build&Run->Qt Versions" tab and verify that Qt automatically detected the Qt version you just installed
(Qt 5.2.1 if you used the installer mentioned above). If not, manually add an appropriate Qt version.
Select the "Build&Run->Kits" tab. Remove any lines listed other than "Desktop (Default)" (select each of the
lines in turn and press the "Remove" button). Select the line "Desktop (Default)" and verify and/or configure
its properties: "Compiler" should be "gcc x86 64-bit", and "Qt version" should be the version you installed
(i.e. Qt 5.2.1 if you used the installer mentioned above).
Finally press the "OK" buttun to accept the changes and close the preferences dialog.

\section InstallUbuGet Getting the SKIRT source code

Proceed as described in \ref InstallMac.

\section InstallUbuConf Configuring the development environment

Proceed as described in \ref InstallMacConfigQt, keeping in mind that on Ubuntu "Preferences" are called "Options",
and that the corresponding dialog is accessed by selecting the "Tools->Options..." menu item.

\section InstallUbuBuild Building SKIRT

Proceed as described in \ref InstallMacBuildQtCreator.

\section InstallUbuDoxStyle Installing the documentation streamliner

Proceed as described in \ref InstallMacDoxStyle, keeping in mind that on Ubuntu "Preferences" are called "Options",
and that the corresponding dialog is accessed by selecting the "Tools->Options..." menu item.
