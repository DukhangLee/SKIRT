\page InstallSource Installing SKIRT on a Unix server

This section explains how to install SKIRT on any Unix system.
After you've followed the guidelines in this section, the SKIRT source code will reside on your computer and so you
can obviously tweak it using your preferred text editor. However if you expect to modify or extend the SKIRT code
in any but the most trivial ways, it is highly recommended to install the full-featured Qt development environment
as described in section \ref InstallMac or \ref InstallUbuntu rather than using the guidelines in this section.

\section InstallSrcPacks Installing development tools

SKIRT is written in C++11, the C++ flavor that was standardized in 2011, extending the language with new features.
The SKIRT source code resides in an online GitHub repository, which you can access from your computer
through the \c git client. Hence you need to install a recent C++ compiler and the \c git client.

Depending on the particular Unix flavor under consideration, you may accomplish this by any of the following
means:
 - use a standard package manager for your system;
 - download and run an installer that was downloaded manually;
 - ask your system manager to install the required tools.

\section InstallSrcGit Configuring the source control client

Before using the \c git client, you should configure it with your user name and email address. This is
especially important if you plan to contribute code to the SKIRT repository. Perform the following commands,
replacing the placeholders with your own name and email address:

\verbatim
git config --global user.name "John Smith"
git config --global user.email john.smith@smithsonian.org
\endverbatim

\section InstallSrcGet Getting the SKIRT source code

Proceed as described in \ref InstallMac.

\section InstallSrcQt Installing the Qt tools and libraries

SKIRT uses the Qt application framework, so the Qt libraries and build tools should be installed on your computer
before attempting to compile or build SKIRT (even if you don't use the full Qt development environment).
Go to the <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt download page</a> and download the Qt libraries source code
version 5.2.1 intended for your system.
SKIRT has been tested with \c qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.2.1.tar.gz on Ubuntu.

The SKIRT source code includes a shell script \c makeQt_everywhere.sh to assist with building Qt from source.
To minimize dependencies on external libraries, the provided script builds only a limited Qt subset that is sufficient
for the current version of SKIRT. You can use the script as is, but more likely you will need to modify it
to suit your needs in the following ways:
 - adjust the value of the \c -prefix option to specify the directory where the Qt libraries will be installed;
 - add a \c -platform option with a value that specifies the appropriate compiler and operating system,
   unless you know that the default will work for your environment; the value of the platform option must be
   the name of one of the subdirectories in the \c mkspecs directory inside the Qt source distribution.

\note On the servers used by the Ghent University SKIRT team, the default platform works fine so you can omit the
\c -platform option.

\note On the Ghent University High Performance Computing (HPC) system, it is highly recommended that you use
the Intel C++ compiler. To accomplish this, add the option "-platform linux-icc-64" in the \c makeQt_everywhere.sh
script, and \em before you execute the script, load the both the \c ictce/7.1.2 and \c GCC/4.8.3 modules
in addition to the \c jobs module (the Intel C++ compiler needs some headers provided by GCC for full C++11 support).
You will need to (re)load these modules before (re)building SKIRT as well.

After editing the script as needed, enter the following shell commands to build Qt from source (it takes a while!):

\verbatim
cd <directory-containing-qt-source-distribution>
tar xvfz qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.2.1.tar.gz
cd qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.2.1
cp ~/SKIRT/git/makeQt_everywhere.sh .
chmod +rx makeQt_everywhere.sh
./makeQt_everywhere.sh
\endverbatim

\section InstallSrcBuild Building SKIRT

The SKIRT source code includes a shell script \c makeSKIRT.sh to assist in building SKIRT
from the source code in the git directory.
If the Qt tools and libraries were not installed in one of the default places, you will need to adjust
the path to \c qmake in the script. Also, before you use the script for the first time, you may need
to make it executable.

To build SKIRT use:

\verbatim
cd ~/SKIRT/git
chmod +rx makeSKIRT.sh
./makeSKIRT.sh
\endverbatim
