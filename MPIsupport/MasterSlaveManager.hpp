/** A MasterSlaveManager object serves to perform a set of similar tasks in parallel in a local
    (shared memory) or remote (distributed memory) context through a "single master - multiple
    slaves" paradigm.

    <B>Usage Example</B>

    Here is a complete example of using this class:

\code
class Compute
{
public:
    Compute(int size, double factor)
        : _size(size), _factor(factor)
    {
        _mgr.setLocalSlaveCount(4);
        _mgr.registerTask(this, &Compute::doSingle);
    }
    void setup()
    {
        _mgr.acquireSlaves();
    }
    ~Compute()
    {
        _mgr.releaseSlaves();
    }
    void doIt()
    {
        if (_mgr.isMaster())
        {
            QVector<QVariant> data(_size);
            for (int i=0; i<_size; i++) data[i] = (double)i;
            data = _mgr.performTask(data);
            for (int i=0; i<_size; i++) std::cout << data[i].toDouble() << " ";
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }
private:
    QVariant doSingle(QVariant input) { return input.toDouble()*_factor; }
    int _size;
    double _factor;
    MasterSlaveManager _mgr;
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    MasterSlaveManager::initialize(&argc, &argv);
    {
        Compute c(7, 2.);
        c.setup();
        c.doIt();
    }
    {
        Compute c(11, 0.5);
        c.setup();
        c.doIt();
    }
    MasterSlaveManager::finalize();
}
\endcode

    When executed this example will print:

\verbatim
0 2 4 6 8 10 12
0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5
\endverbatim

    The constructor of the Compute class initializes a MasterSlaveManager instance and registers
    one of its own methods as a task to be performed by one or more slaves in parallel. The setup()
    function prepares the slaves to receive work. This is split off from the constructor to ensure
    that the Compute object has been fully constructed before calling the acquireSlaves() function,
    which doesn't return immediately on remote slaves. The doIt() function does work only if it is
    running from the master; in that case it prepares some data, commands the slaves to perform
    parallel work on each of the data elements, and finally prints the results.

    The main() function constructs two different Compute objects and performs the corresponding
    calculations. Any context created before calling the acquireSlaves() function (such as the
    multiplication factor in the example) can be used in the slave computations, even if they are
    performed remotely. This is possible because each remote slave also executes all code until the
    acquireSlaves() function is called. For a remote slave, this function starts a communication
    loop that exits when the master calls the releaseSlaves() function. In fact, the two code
    segments are each surrounded by curly braces so that the Compute object would go out of scope
    and execute its destructor, releasing the slaves.

    <B>Parallel Modes</B>

    In local mode the class uses a Parallel object spawned from a privately owned ParallelFactory
    instance. In remote mode the implementation relies on MPI (Message Passing Interface) for
    communication between master and slaves. The implementation automatically selects remote mode
    if the code was compiled and built with MPI support, and if the code is executed under MPI
    control on more than a single node. In all other cases local mode is used instead.

    <B>Passing Data to and from the slaves</B>

    Except for any context established before calling the acquireSlaves() function, all information
    passed from the master to a slave and back must be serialized to a flat byte stream (at least
    in remote mode). This is accomplished through the use of QVariant objects, which can hold
    values of variable type from scalars up to complex data structures, and which can be
    serialized using standard Qt functionality. Refer to the Qt documentation for more info.

    <B>Thread safety (or lack thereof)</B>

    With the exception of isMaster() and isSlave(), all MasterSlaveManager functions (including
    static initialization and instance construction) must be invoked from the very same thread.
    Usually this will be the main program thread. In some key places, a fatal error is thrown if
    this restriction is violated.
